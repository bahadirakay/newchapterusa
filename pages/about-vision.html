        <h2>Meet Dr. Mehtap Akay</h2>
        <p>I am Dr. Mehtap Akay, an educator, researcher, and multilingual learning specialist with more than sixteen years of experience across K–12 schools, refugee resettlement programs, higher education, and adult and teacher education. As the founder and principal coach at New Chapter Coaching &amp; Consulting, I partner with schools, universities, nonprofits, and professionals to design inclusive, culturally responsive, and equitable learning experiences that empower both educators and multilingual learners.</p>

            <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
            <p>My work is deeply personal. It grows out of my own journey as an immigrant, multilingual, and multicultural educator navigating new languages, systems, and cultures. These experiences taught me the power of belonging, the importance of culturally responsive teaching, and the need for compassionate, inclusive support for both learners and educators.</p>
            <p>Over the past sixteen years, I have worked across classrooms, communities, and continents—from K–12 schools to higher education and nonprofit organizations. As a teacher educator, I have had the privilege of preparing and mentoring future teachers, helping them build the confidence, empathy, and skills to serve diverse students and families.</p>
            <p>I believe that strong, well-supported teachers lead to well-supported students and families. Effective professional learning should empower educators as much as it empowers learners.</p>
            <p>Through New Chapter Coaching &amp; Consulting, my team and I bring this belief to life. We collaborate with schools, universities, nonprofits, and individuals to design professional learning, coaching, and consulting experiences that honor multilingualism, strengthen equity, and foster community.</p>
            <p>Our approach blends research-based strategies with heart-centered practice, creating learning environments where educators, students, and families can grow and thrive together.</p>
